# IBP-Website-Project
Here is my first website project!
I used AdminLTE templete for frontend and customized it to my desire.
Backend was done with PHP by completely me.

Purpose of the website is to manage prisoner informations for prisons. You can review prisoner's status in 2 different modes, normal user and admin.
Normal users can see why and when a prisoner was arrested. Admins can edit their information.
All data about prisoners are stored in a local PHPAdmin database.
